# Array

An array is a data structure that stores a **collection of elements** of the same data type. The elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, which means that they are stored in a sequence.

# Array Operations

## Accessing an element

To access an element of an array, you need to specify its index. The index is the position of the element in the array. For example, to access the first element of an array, you would use the index 0.

## Inserting an element

To insert an element into an array, you need to specify the index at which you want to insert the element. The element will be inserted after the element at the specified index.

## Deleting an element

To delete an element from an array, you need to specify the index of the element to be deleted. The element will be removed from the array.

## Searching an element

To search for an element in an array, you need to specify the value of the element you are searching for. The array will be searched for the element, and the index of the element will be returned if it is found.
